# Unexpected Equality Check with Nullable Values and Null-Aware Operator

This code demonstrates a potential issue with nullable values and the null-aware operator (??). When comparing objects with nullable fields initialized to null, using the null-aware operator can lead to unexpected equality checks.

The problem arises when the null-aware operator provides a default value for a null field. If the default value is the same for different objects, a comparison might return true even if the objects are different.

The solution is to either avoid using the null-aware operator for equality checks or to use a different comparison approach that takes into account the null state of the values.

## How to reproduce

1. Run the provided Dart code.
2. Observe the unexpected output for the equality check between `obj` and `obj2`.
